From animation standpoint, this is how I would want to have it added onto this page. So when you select an image, the whole thing should slide either to the right or to the left meaning if you click the left image then both the left and the right image would at the same time slide to the right, and the right image would start to fade away in .2 seconds and the left image would slide into the center in 0.5 seconds seconds, and then it would stay there for 0.5 seconds until the next set of image comes and when the next set of image comes in, I would like to fade away the selected image and fade in the new images and that transition should just be 0.2 seconds.
